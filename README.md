Hello there!
I wanna show you, what I've learned during my programming course :)

First game - it's nuclear winter simulator. You need to choose, what kind of sources you want to extend - of course it's not that easy. Game has instruction :)

Second game - it's fight game. You choose character and his statistics. What is good, you can make your own hero and fight with friend!

Website - it's page about helping enviroment. You can read about Equatorial Forest and how to help enviroment. You can also go to WWF and OurPlanet.com pages - you just need to click third or fourth link.
